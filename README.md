# sqlalchemy-challenge

Using sqlalchemy, pandas, matplotlib, and python, an analysis on climate data from Hawaii was made to plan a future vacation. Precipitation and temperature data from the past 12 months was queried using pandas, in addition to the number of stations. 

Flask was used to create an app with various routes, including one for precipitation data, one for station data, one for temperature data, one for the weather data from one specific date, and one for weather data for a range of dates.
